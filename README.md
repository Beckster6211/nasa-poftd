# Picture Of The Day :milky_way:

Nasa has a program called Astronomy picture of the day. This app lets you see the pictures and information about it, with the calendar provided you can select a specific date.

## Why? :question:

This project uses react and useEffect to perform fetch data to nasa api.

### How to use :telescope:

On the site you will be presented with a calendar drop down, using this you can select a date.

Dates shown monthly with an up and down arrow (on the top right hand side) allowing you to toggle through the months, you can also browse through years by selecting the month and year on the top left. (You can get back to the current date by clicking "Today" in the bottom right).

When a date has been selected you are presented with the picture of the day for that day as well as a heading of what the picture is and a description detailing the photo.

#### :calendar: If your born after 16th June 1995 (earliest that can go back) you can get Nasa's picture of the day on the day you were born... (pretty cool, I'm to old... :sob: )

###### If your interested

:camera:

The pictures above the calendar:

Picture #1 is of commander Eugene Cernan (Apollo 17) credited as being "The last man on the moon".

Picture #2 is of the Apollo 11 landing crew from left to right Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Pilot Michael Collins and Lunar Pilot Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin.

Picture #3 is of what I believe is Nasa and historys most iconic moment, Neil Armstrong first step on the moon.

Picture #4 is of the Nasa logo

There are also some links at the bottom of the page that will takes you to videos showing the Apollo 11 mission :smiley:
