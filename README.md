# Nasa Picture Of The Day :milky_way:

Nasa has a program called Astronomy picture of the day. This app lets you see the pictures and information about it, with the calendar provided you can select a specific date.

## :confused: Why? :question:

This project uses react and useEffect to perform fetch data to nasa api.

### How to use :telescope:

Onthe site you will be presented with a calendar drop down, using this you can select a date.

Dates shown monthly with an up and down arrow (on the top right hand side) allowing you to toggle through the months, you can also browse through years by selecting the month and year on the top left. (You can get back to the current date by clicking today in the bottom right).

When a date has been selected you are presented with the picture of the day for that day as well as a heading of what the picture is and a description detailing the photo.

#### If your born before 16th June 1995 (earliest that can go back) you can get Nasa's picture of the day on the day you were born... (pretty cool, I'm to old...) :calendar:

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
